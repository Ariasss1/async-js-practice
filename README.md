# Asynchronous JavaScript Practice – Promises & Async/Await

This project focuses on understanding and implementing asynchronous behavior in JavaScript using modern techniques.

Developed as part of JavaScript practice to strengthen async programming fundamentals.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The main goal of this project is to understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using:

- Promises
- async/await
- Fetch API
- Error handling
- JSON data processing

---

## 🛠 Concepts Implemented

### 1️⃣ Promises

- Creating custom promises
- Handling resolve and reject
- Using `.then()` and `.catch()`

---

### 2️⃣ Async / Await

- Writing cleaner asynchronous code
- Handling errors using try/catch
- Sequential async execution

---

### 3️⃣ Fetch API

- Making HTTP requests
- Parsing JSON responses
- Handling network errors

---

## 🚀 Skills Practiced

- Asynchronous programming
- API integration
- Error handling
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Clean and readable async logic

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

- How JavaScript handles asynchronous execution
- The event loop basics
- Writing scalable async functions
- Structuring clean async code
